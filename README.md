Grad-CAM: Visualizing CNN Decisions
This project implements Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to visually explain the decision-making process of a pre-trained ResNet50 model. The technique produces a class-specific heatmap to highlight salient image regions that are most influential for a given prediction.

Method
The heatmap is generated by computing the gradient of the class score with respect to the feature maps of the final convolutional layer. These gradients are used as weights to compute a weighted sum of the feature maps, identifying regions of high importance for the model's prediction.

Usage & Dependencies
Install the required libraries:
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python matplotlib requests

Bash

pip install torch torchvision opencv-python matplotlib requests
Run the Jupyter Notebook grad_cam_implementation.ipynb.
